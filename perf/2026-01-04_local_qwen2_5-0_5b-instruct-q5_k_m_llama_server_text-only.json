It uses quantum bits or \"qubits\" instead of classical bits that can only be in two states (0 or 1). Qubits can exist in multiple states at the same time, thanks to a phenomenon called superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations in parallel, making them much faster and more powerful than classical computers. \n\nA real-world analogy is the way that quantum computers",
